1) What are Java Operators?
-- Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
Classification: Arithmetic Operators, Comparison Operators, Logical Operators, Assignment Operators

2) What are Arithmetic Operators?
-- Arithmetic operators are used to perform common mathematical operations. see below:

+ Addition
- Subtraction
* Multiplication
/ Division
% Modulus/Remainder
Below 2 will use when we will learn loop
++ Increment
-- Decrement

3) What are Comparison Operators?
-- Comparison operators are used to compare two values. see below:

== Equal to operator
!= Not Equal
> Greater than 
< Less than
>= Greater than or equal to
<= Less than or equal to

4) What are Logical Operators?
-- Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values. see below:

&& -->  Logical and operator ---> (Returns true if both statements are true, 
x < 5 &&  y < 10)
|| --> Logical or operator ---> (Returns true if one of the statements is true,
x < 5 || y < 4)
!  -->  Logical not operator (Reverse the result, returns false if the result is true, (!(x < 5 && y < 10))

5) What are Assignment Operators? (When we learn loop, we will use them, )
-- Assignment operators are used to assign values to variables. see below:
			Example     What does it mean
=         x=5            x=5
+=       x+=3          x=x+3
-=        x-=3           x=x-3

6) What is a Conditional Statement?
-- Conditional Statements allow the program to behave differently based on condition. 
-- Example: if, else, else if, switch.

7) Describe- if else condition.
-- First keyword is if. Generally we don't use - 2 if condition (code wise OK), 
-- rather we use 'if' as first condition and 'else or else if' as second condition. 
-- Generally the true statement is written at the end.
-- When we write 'else', no condition is necessary to write,
-- Whatever you want to print, it will be printed in else block. either it is true or false, correct or incorrect, it doesn't matter
-- But if we wish to write a second condition , we have to use 'else if', not 'else' 
-- first condition 'if', last condition generally 'else', but not always, 'else if' is also ok at the end of the condition
-- if there are more condition, you can use more than one 'else if' 

8) What is an Even number?
-- A number divided by 2 with remainder 0.
-- Example - 56 : 8/2 --- quotient 28, remainder 0

9) What is an Odd number?
-- A number divided by 2 with remainder 1.
-- Example - 37 : 9/2 --- quotient 18, remainder 1

10) What is Java Nested if statement?
-- The nested if statement represents the if block within another if block. Here, the inner if block condition executes only when the outer if block condition is true.
 
11) What is Short-hand If...Else condition? Or Ternary Operator?
-- There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands. It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements:
Syntax: variable = (condition) ? expressionTrue : expressionFalse;
