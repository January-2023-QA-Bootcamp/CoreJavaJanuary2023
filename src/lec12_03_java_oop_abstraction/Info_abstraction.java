1) What is Java?
-- Java is an object-oriented programming(OOP) language.

2) Write down the OOP features.
-- Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism are the features of Java OOP.

3) What is Interface?
-- Interface is a Blueprint of Class. 
-- Interface cannot be instantiated (cannot create object)
-- An interface is a collection of methods that are defined but not implemented. 
-- Contains only abstract methods.
-- Abstract method can not be implemented, can be defined  (declared) only
-- *Contains default and static method only which are non abstract(exception)

4) What is Abstract class?
-- An abstract class is a super class that cannot be instantiated (can't create objects).
-- Contains both abstract and non abstract methods.
-- Abstract method can not be implemented, can be defined only
-- Non abstract methods can be implemented, but can not be defined.

5) What is a class in Java?
-- Class is a blueprint from which individual objects are created.
-- Contains only non abstract methods, doesn't contain abstract methods.
-- Methods only implemented but can't be declared.
-- implements and extends keyword is used for inheritance

6) Which keyword is used by a regular class to inherit a regular class or abstract class?
-- extends keyword

7) Which keyword is used by an abstract class to inherit a regular class or abstract class?
-- extends keyword

8) How many regular classes or abstract classes are inherited by a regular or abstract class by extends keyword?
-- Only one

9) How many interfaces are inherited by a regular or abstract class by extends keyword?
-- Zero

10) How many methods are declared inside a regular class?
-- Zero

11) Can methods be implemented in Interface? What type of methods are implemented inside Interface?
-- Yes, default and static type.

12) Which keyword is used by an Interface to inherit a regular class or abstract class?
-- an Interface cannot inherit a regular class or abstract class

13) How many regular or abstract classes are inherited by interface by extends keywords?
-- Zero

14) How many Interfaces are inherited by an interface by extends keywords?
-- More than one

15) From which version JAVA implemented static and default type methods in interface?
-- 1.8

16) default and static methods used in interface are abstract or non-abstract?
-- non-abstract

17) Is it mandatory to use the 'abstract' keyword in the abstract method of Interface?
-- No.

18) Is it mandatory to use the 'abstract' keyword in the abstract method of Abstract class?
-- Yes.

19)  Are all the declared methods in Interface abstract in nature?
-- Yes.

20) Method can be either implemented or declared in an abstract class?
-- False

21)  Are all the declared methods in Abstract class abstract in nature?
-- Yes.
