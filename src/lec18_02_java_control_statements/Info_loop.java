/*
1) Control statements allows to control the number of times a statement should get executed. 
For example: for loop, while loop etc.

2) Programmers usually use loops to execute a set of statements. 
For loop is used when they need to iterate a part of the programs multiple times. 
It is particularly used in cases where the number of iterations is fixed!

3) The Java while loop is used to iterate a part of the program again and again. 
If the number of iteration is not fixed, then you can use while loop.

3) Do-while loop is similar to while loop, but it possesses one dissimilarity: In while loop, 
the condition is evaluated before the execution of loop's body 
but in do-while loop condition is evaluated after the execution of loop's body.
