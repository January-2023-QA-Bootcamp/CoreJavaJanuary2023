/*
What is Java Type Casting?
-- Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.
-- In Java, there are two types of casting:

Widening Casting (automatically) - Widening casting is done automatically when passing a smaller size type to a larger size type

Narrowing Casting (manually) - Narrowing casting must be done manually by placing the type in parentheses in front of the value.
