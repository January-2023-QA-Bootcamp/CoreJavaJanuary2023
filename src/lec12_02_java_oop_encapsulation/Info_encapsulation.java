/*
Encapsulation:

1) Write down the OOP features.
-- Abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation and Polymorphism are the features of Java OOP.

2) What is Encapsulation?
-- Encapsulation means data hiding. By doing encapsulation, data only can be accessed by public methods. 
-- There are various ways to hide the data. By making method and variable private, then the access limits to the same class user only.
-- By using getter and setter method private data can be accessed *****
-- in a short -- Hiding, implementation of methods and data from users is called encapsulation.
-- It improves maintainability and flexibility and reusability. The fields can be made read-only. Users would not be knowing what is going on behind the scene. They would only be knowing that to update a field call set method and to read a field call get method but what these set and get methods are doing is purely hidden from them.

3) A private variable can only be used inside the same class (please see above image). Subclass or non subclass can't access them.

4) To get access of private variable we create getter and setter method by following way:
-- select variable
-- right click -- source -- Generate Getters and Setters -- select variables -- insertion point: after the last variable present inside the class --- sorts by: Fields in getter/setter pair

5) other way: from the header -- source --  Generate Getters and Setters -- select variables -- insertion point: after the last variable present inside the class --- sorts by: Fields in getter/setter pair
